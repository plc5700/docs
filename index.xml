      <description>Why write technical documentation?  The best documentation is no documentation: code should be self-explanatory.
All the lazy developers in history
 Writing documentation is hard.
We try to find excuses and rationalize and lie to ourselves so we can feel better about with the fact that we should be doing it, but it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;too much work&amp;rdquo;.
Here are two good reasons to try and convince you to start writing documentation, and help you while you help others, too:</description>

      <description>File structure for a PrestaShop module A module is made of a lot of files, all stored in a folder that bears the same name as the module, that folder being in turn stored in the /modules folder at the root of the main PrestaShop folder: /modules/name_of_the_module/.
Here are the possible files and folders for a PrestaShop 1.7 module:

      <description>List of hooks in PrestaShop 1.7 Update notes A couple of hooks were modified between 1.7.0.x and 1.7.1.x.
 actionDeleteProductInCartAfter has been divided into two hooks:  actionObjectProductInCartDeleteBefore. actionObjectProductInCartDeleteAfter.  displayProductButtons has been renamed into displayProductAdditionalInfo.
Don’t worry, we kept an alias :)  Full list  action&amp;lt;AdminControllerName&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Action&amp;gt;After Called after performing &amp;lt;Action&amp;gt; in any &amp;lt;AdminController&amp;gt;
Located in: /classes/controller/AdminController.php
Parameters:
array( &#39;controller&#39; =&amp;gt; (AdminController), &#39;return&#39; =&amp;gt; (mixed) );  action&amp;lt;AdminControllerName&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Action&amp;gt;Before Called before performing &amp;lt;Action&amp;gt; in any &amp;lt;AdminController&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>About the config.xml file The config.xml file makes it possible to optimize the loading of the module list in the back office.

      <title>Use hooks on modern pages</title>
      <link>http://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/hooks/use_hooks_on_modern_pages/</link>

      <guid>http://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/hooks/use_hooks_on_modern_pages/</guid>
      <description>Use hooks on modern pages You know you can already customize your PrestaShop store thanks to many hooks: the good news is that you can still use hooks like you did in the earlier versions of PrestaShop in modern pages.
Starting from PrestaShop 1.7.3, you can access the modern Services Container into your modules and so on access powerful and customizable features available in Symfony:
 Twig, the most popular templating engine; Swiftmailer, a feature-rich mailer; Doctrine ORM and Doctrine DBAL to manage your database; Filesystem and Finder libraries to manage all filesystem operations; Monolog for every logging operations; Serializer library for whom who need to manipulate Json and Xml formats&amp;hellip;  Of course, you also have access to every service used by the Core of PrestaShop.</description>

      <title>Adding a configuration page</title>
      <link>http://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/creation/adding_configuration_page/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/creation/adding_configuration_page/</guid>
      <description>Adding a configuration page Your module can get a &amp;ldquo;Configure&amp;rdquo; link in the back office module list, and therefore let the user change some settings. This &amp;ldquo;Configure&amp;rdquo; link appears with addition of the getContent() method to your main class. This is a standard PrestaShop method: its sole existence sends a message to the back office, saying &amp;ldquo;there&amp;rsquo;s a configuration page in this module, display the configuration link&amp;rdquo;.
But having a getContent() public method in the MyModule object does only make the &amp;ldquo;Configure&amp;rdquo; link appear; it does not create the configuration page out of nowhere.</description>

      <title>Alter forms on modern pages</title>
      <link>http://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/hooks/alter_forms_on_modern_pages/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/hooks/alter_forms_on_modern_pages/</guid>
      <description>Alter forms on modern pages One of the most common tasks for the PrestaShop developers is to alter the data and make it manageable for customers. In PrestaShop 1.6, a specific Form framework was created to help developers. In PrestaShop 1.7, the system has changed as we now rely on the Symfony Form component.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see an example on how to add, populate, validate and persist a new form field in PrestaShop 1.</description>

      <title>Displaying content on the front office</title>
      <link>http://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/creation/displaying_content_in_front_office/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/creation/displaying_content_in_front_office/</guid>
      <description>Displaying content on the front office As it is, the module does not do much. In order to display something on the front office, we have to add support for a few hooks. This is done by implementing the hooks&amp;rsquo; methods, and that was actually done in the install() method we wrote earlier, using the registerHook() method:
public function install() { if (Shop::isFeatureActive()) Shop::setContext(Shop::CONTEXT_ALL); return parent::install() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $this-&amp;gt;registerHook(&#39;leftColumn&#39;) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $this-&amp;gt;registerHook(&#39;header&#39;) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Configuration::updateValue(&#39;MYMODULE_NAME&#39;, &#39;my friend&#39;); }  As you can see, we make it so that the module is hooked to the &amp;ldquo;leftColumn&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;header&amp;rdquo; hooks.</description>

      <description>Fundamentals of PrestaShop Development PrestaShop was conceived so that third-party modules could easily build upon its foundations, making it an extremely customizable e-commerce software.
PrestaShop’s customization is based on three possibilities:
 Themes, Modules, Overriding.  Themes are explored in full in the Designer Guide.
Modules and the override system are explored in this Developer Guide, starting with the “Concepts” section below. You can learn more about each in the following chapters:</description>

      <title>Enabling the Auto-Update</title>
      <link>http://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/creation/enabling_auto_update/</link>

      <guid>http://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/creation/enabling_auto_update/</guid>
      <description>Enabling the Auto-Update Since PrestaShop 1.5, it is possible to have your module auto-update: once a new version is available on Addons, PrestaShop suggests an &amp;ldquo;Update it!&amp;rdquo; button to the user. Clicking this button will trigger a series of methods, each leading closer to the latest version of your module.
In order to bring auto-update support to your module, you need three main things:
 Clearly indicate the module&amp;rsquo;s version number in its constructor method: $this-&amp;gt;version = &#39;1.</description>

      <title>Module translation</title>
      <link>http://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/creation/module_translation/</link>

      <guid>http://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/creation/module_translation/</guid>
      <description>Module translation The module&amp;rsquo;s text strings are written in English, but you might want French, Spanish or Polish shop owners to use your module too. You therefore have to translate those strings into those languages, both the front office and the back office strings. Ideally, you should translate your module in all the languages that are installed on your shop. This could be a tedious task, but a whole system has been put in place in order to help you out.</description>

      <description>Configuring PrestaShop By default, PrestaShop is configured to provide a secure and stable environment to both the shop administrator and the customers.
As a developer, there are several changes that you could and should bring to the default installation in order to help you code better, spot bugs faster, and generally make a great PrestaShop product.
Disabling the cache and forcing Smarty compilation When your development has an impact on the front office, whether you are building a theme or simply a module which displays information to the customer, you should force the template file compilation and disable the cache, so as to always see the result of your changes directly.</description>

      <description>Commits &amp;amp; Pull Requests conventions Commits In the past, we used to have only one commit by pull request. This was a bad habit. We now require contributors to make atomic commits, so you will surely have more than one commit in a single pull request. This will be helpful to review, cherry-pick or revert (we hope to never have to do that 😉) the changes.
What&amp;rsquo;s an atomic commit?</description>

      <description>The DBQuery class The DBQuery class is a query builder which helps you create SQL queries. For instance:
$sql = new DbQuery(); $sql-&amp;gt;select(&#39;*&#39;); $sql-&amp;gt;from(&#39;cms&#39;, &#39;c&#39;); $sql-&amp;gt;innerJoin(&#39;cms_lang&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;c.id_cms = l.id_cms AND l.id_lang = &#39;.(int)$id_lang); $sql-&amp;gt;where(&#39;c.active = 1&#39;); $sql-&amp;gt;orderBy(&#39;position&#39;); return Db::getInstance()-&amp;gt;executeS($sql);  Main methods  __toString()  Generate and get the query.  build()  Generate and get the query (return a string).  from(string $table, mixed $alias = null)  Set table for FROM clause.</description>

      <guid>http://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/themes/migration_from_16/</guid>
      <description>Migrating from PrestaShop 1.6 PrestaShop 1.7 introduces a totally reworked theme system from version 1.6, with the goal of making PrestaShop upgrades easier, and making it easier and faster to create a brand new theme.
The huge change to the theme system means that there is no easy way to migrate your PrestaShop 1.6 theme to PrestaShop 1.7.
When using the automatic upgrade from PrestaShop 1.6 to 1.7, your theme will be switched to the new default theme, called &amp;ldquo;Classic&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>The ObjectModel class When needing to dive deep, you have to use the ObjectModel class. This is the main object of PrestaShop’s object model. It can be overridden… with precaution.
It is an Active Record kind of class (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern). The table attributes or view attributes of PrestaShop’s database are encapsulated in this class. Therefore, the class is tied to a database record. After the object has been instantiated, a new record is added to the database.</description>

      <guid>http://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/themes/rtl/</guid>
      <description>RTL support PrestaShop supports RTL (Right-to-left) themes natively.
RTL stylesheets There are two ways of customizing your theme for RTL: either by adding an override file that is only loaded for RTL languages, or by using completely different version of the theme&amp;rsquo;s stylesheets.
CSS override file PrestaShop will try to load a css file named rtl.css after your theme&amp;rsquo;s ones when displayed in an RTL language. You can use this file to place any style override you need for RTL.</description>

      <description>Setting up your local environment Now that you intend to building a theme for PrestaShop, you are better off keeping all your development work on your machine. The main advantage is that it makes it possible for you to entirely bypass the process of uploading your files on your online server in order to test your changes. Another advantage is that a local test environment enables you to test code without the risk of breaking your production store.</description>

      <description>The PrestaShop architecture The PrestaShop developers have done their best to clearly and intuitively separate the various parts of the software.
Here is how the files are organized:
 /admin (the name is customized on installation): contains all the PrestaShop files pertaining to the back office. When accessing this folder with your browser, you will be asked to provide proper identification, for security reasons. Important: you should make sure to protect that folder with a .</description>
